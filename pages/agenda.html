            LLM-powered full-stack app sidestepping complex and fragmented
            typical LLM stacks such as vector databases, additional frameworks,
            or cache services. You will learn how to use open-source projects
            efficiently in Python to facilitate real-time in-memory data
            indexing, pulling directly from compatible storage.
